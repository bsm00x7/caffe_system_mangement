📌 **PROJECT BRIEF — Café Management System App**
=================================================

🧩 **1\. Problem Statement**
----------------------------

Managing a café manually creates several daily challenges:

### **📉 Operational Problems**

*   Difficult to track **what employees buy** during the day.
    
*   No accurate record of **daily sales or purchases**.
    
*   Stock management is chaotic (stock missing, no alerts, overspending).
    
*   Admin wastes time writing everything on paper.
    
*   No central system to **track employer performance**.
    
*   Reports are inconsistent or incomplete.
    
*   Items added by hand → high chance of errors.
    

### **👥 Employee Management Problems**

*   Employers have no simple way to log purchases.
    
*   Admin cannot know:
    
    *   Who bought what?
        
    *   At what time?
        
    *   How much was spent?
        

### **📄 Reporting Problems**

*   No daily summaries.
    
*   No analytics.
    
*   No automatic calculation of totals.
    
*   No digital export (PDF).
